Initial diameter of monodisperse particles(nm): 1
Initial number concentration(#/m3): 1e24
Temperature(Kelvin): 1800


In the output, you'll get the estimated time requred for the distribution to become self preserving. Various number concentrations will be printed with time until the estimated time 
is reached. After the code runs for the estimated time to reach SPD, the final size distribution will be printed.

If you wish to run the code for a longer time, you should make the following change in line "160" of the code. Suppose you want to run the code for 1e-2 seconds and observe the size 
distribution after that,

Replace the condition: "while(t<t_SPD)" with "while(t<1e-2)"
